# Supabase Email Confirmation - MUST DISABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT

## The Problem

Your signup API returns `"confirmation_sent_at": "2025-10-10T10:19:35.895356733Z"`, which means **email confirmation is ENABLED** in Supabase.

This causes the infinite loading screen because:
1. User signs up successfully
2. Supabase sends confirmation email
3. User's email is NOT verified yet
4. AuthContext tries to load profile but session is not fully authenticated
5. Loading state never resolves

---

## IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Disable Email Confirmation (2 minutes)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gfoemzogpygwsapqtxsy

2. Navigate to: **Authentication → Settings → Email Auth**

3. Find: **"Enable email confirmations"**

4. **UNCHECK THIS OPTION** ✅

5. Click **Save**

### Why Disable It?

For development and testing, email confirmation adds unnecessary friction:
- Requires real email delivery
- Users can't test immediately
- Complicates the auth flow

You can enable it later for production once the flow is working.

## What This Fixes

After disabling email confirmation:
- ✅ Signup works immediately without email verification
- ✅ User can login right after signup
- ✅ No waiting for confirmation emails
- ✅ Loading screen resolves properly
- ✅ Profile loads successfully

---

## For Production (Future)

When you're ready for production, you can re-enable email confirmation and:

1. Implement an "Email Verification Pending" screen
2. Add a "Resend Verification Email" button
3. Handle the verification callback URL
4. Show clear messaging to users

But for now, **DISABLE IT** to unblock development.

**MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED**: Please disable email confirmation in your Supabase dashboard now.

After you do this, the code changes I'm about to implement will work perfectly!
