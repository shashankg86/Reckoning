## ‚ö†Ô∏è About Google OAuth

### The Situation:
- Google OAuth requires **manual dashboard configuration**
- Your Supabase was auto-created by the development environment
- Dashboard access might be **managed/restricted** in this setup

### Your Options:

#### Option 1: Use Email Authentication (RECOMMENDED)
**This works perfectly right now!**
- No dashboard access needed
- No configuration required
- Fully functional
- Ready to use immediately

#### Option 2: Try Dashboard Access
If you want to attempt accessing the dashboard:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Try logging in with:
   - GitHub
   - Google
   - Email

**However:** Since this project was auto-created, you might not have direct dashboard access. The project might be managed by the development environment.

#### Option 3: Create Your Own Supabase Project
If you need full dashboard access:

1. Create a free Supabase account at: https://supabase.com
2. Create a new project
3. Copy the new credentials
4. Update your `.env` file with new credentials
5. Run migrations to set up database
6. Enable Google OAuth in dashboard
